From 1.0 up through 1.1.13, there was a single line of development.
Right after 1.1.13 the main development branch became 2.0.00, with a
stable branch for further 1.x.xx version releases to bring out bugfixes
and backport minor new features until 2.0.00 is ready.


    > 1.2.00 (build OV20171005)
- Simple sound effects for game events: Start of client player's turn, resource stolen by robber, etc
- Game windows have same size as previous game if resized, not small default size
- Re-word trade offer announcements to clarify who would give which resources

- To avoid disruptions by game observers, only players can chat after initial placement
- Client:
     - Persistent and per-game preferences for settings like sound effects and game window size
     - Per-game preference to auto-reject bot trades after a multi-second countdown
     - Re-worded other players' trade offer displays to: Gives You / They Get
     - More natural window positioning (follow OS standard, was previously always in upper-left corner)
     - Initial Connect dialog: If username given, ensure New Game button is enabled
     - New Game options: Popup if old versions can't play: Default to Create, not Change Options
- Users can't use the robot nickname prefixes "droid " or "robot ", or "debug" except in debug mode
- Network:
     - Send keepalive messages to idle games to keep clients connected
     - Text messages to channels can be sent only by members
- Database:
     - To create users, an Account Admins list is required (jsettlers.accounts.admins property)
       unless using Open Registration mode
     - Optional Schema Upgrade process with -Djsettlers.db.upgrade_schema=Y startup option
     - Upgraded Schema v1.2.00 adds:
         - games table: winner, options, duration, player 5 and 6 names and scores
         - users table: case-insensitive unique usernames/nicknames; password encodings (BCrypt)
         - db_version table, with upgrade history if any
         - settings table
     - New admin command *DBSETTINGS*: Show schema version, DB server version, settings entries
     - If using mysql: Newly created DBs now have unicode text encoding (UTF-8).
       (The postgresql and sqlite DB scripts have always created the DB as unicode.)
     - If using postgresql: Tables are created by socuser, not postgres system user
- Game window during debug: Reset "current player" indicator when exiting *FREEPLACE* debug mode
- Client debug, bot debug: Print network message contents if system property jsettlers.debug.traffic is set

    > 1.1.20 (build OV20161024)
- Board hex graphics updated for smoother look and scaling
- Game window board panel resize:
     Much better performance and reliability by using good-quality synchronous Graphics2D.drawImage
     Use smooth vectors, not scaled-up images, for ports
- Game window:
     Guidance for new users: After initial placement, if user tries left-clicking the board to build,
        popup a hint message to use right-click (or control-click on OSX) instead
     Trade offers from other players: Show/hide Accept button whenever resources gained/lost/traded
     Print message in chat area when player leaves, to balance message when a player joins
     For visibility use black text for Longest Road, Largest Army labels
- New Game options dialog:
     When "Use 6-player board" option becomes set, increase max players to 6 unless already changed by user
     For int/intbool options use 0 if blank, intbool don't set int value if checkbox is unchecked
- *ADDTIME* command: Don't add time if more than 90 minutes still remaining
- *HELP* command recognized from all players, not only debug user
- Server startup options:
     New optional jsserver.properties file, read before command line
     Command line: db user and password now optional when specifying port and max connections
     Unknown options no longer ignored: Prints each one and a short help message, will not continue startup
     Default max connections increased from 30 to 40
- Game option defaults can be properties in that file or command line: jsettlers.gameopt.RD=y
- Game option boolean default values more strictly parsed
- Robots:
     When a 7 is rolled during other players' turns and bot must discard:
        If bot is inactive after several seconds, force random resource discard
     To keep idle practice games alive, don't leave an inactive game during other players' turns
- Server stats (*STATS* command): Increase "games finished" when game is won, not later when it's destroyed
- *WHO* command: User admins or debug user can list any game's members, or * or ALL to list all connected users
- Game or channel name "*" no longer permitted, to avoid conflicts with admin command enhancements
- Server console traces:
     "joined the game"/"left the game" include current time
     Remove redundant joined/left debug prints
- Debug commands dev: and rsrcs: also accept player number instead of name, for long or complex names
- Client startup: Always print version on console, even to print usage and exit
- Deactivate client debug prints of network message contents
- Optional user accounts:
     Warn if database is empty when config requires accounts or names the account admins
     DB setup script: Correct grant commands for postgresql 8 (for CentOS 6/RHEL 6)
- User account admin:
     New server parameter --pw-reset username can be used if an account password is lost
     *WHO* user-admin command available when only certain users can create accounts (jsettlers.accounts.admins=...)
- User account admin client:
     After creating new user, clear password fields in form
     Auto-authenticate when creating first admin account in new db
     Minimum server version 1.1.19; for older servers, please download and use the older version's account client
     Server requires minimum client version 1.1.19, to authenticate before creating users
- User account DB schema: For new installs, require user passwords (existing DBs don't need to make this change).
     Passwords were already required in earlier versions; this only formalizes it in the database.
- For bots in server jar, move SOCDisplaylessPlayerClient out of soc.client package
- First version to include an automated functional test script

    > 1.1.19 (build OV20141127)

- Client Connect to Server, Start Server screens: If port number field is empty, use default 8880
- Check client password when "New game" is clicked, not later after filling out game options
- Security: Reply with "incorrect password" when username doesn't exist in server's database
- Account Creation/Security when using the optional user account database:
     By default, open registration is now disabled: Only existing users can create new accounts.
     To permit open registration of accounts, use -Djsettlers.accounts.open=y when starting the server.
     To require that all players have accounts and passwords, start the server with: -Djsettlers.accounts.required=y
     To permit only certain users to create accounts, use -Djsettlers.accounts.admins=bob,joe,lily
     (comma-separated username list) when starting the server.
     Once the client has successfully joined or created a game or channel, it won't send a password again.
- Database: Add instructions and db-create scripts for postgresql, sqlite
- When saving 6-player completed game results to a database table with only 4 player fields,
     rearrange positions to ensure human player in seat# 5 and/or 6 are recorded, especially if they won

- Bots connecting require a security cookie, randomly generated at server startup.
     The built-in bots started automatically by SOCServer will know the cookie value.
     To set the cookie to a given value, set the jsettlers.bots.cookie parameter.
     To print the cookie value in order to connect other bots, use -Djsettlers.bots.showcookie=Y when starting the server.
- Server stats include client versions seen since startup
- Server command line game option settings: Also allow y or Y for boolean options
- Server command line: Exit if any -D or -o parameter appears more than once
- On server startup, exit if a database URL is given but SOCServer can't connect to the database.

    > 1.0.4 (build 2004-06-10)  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsettlers

- build.xml file added for Ant builds

  version and copyright info from build.xml. Clients and server updated
- Build process creates two jar files: one for client, one for server
- README updated for jar file invocation, with additional sections for
  intro, requirements, hosting a server, and development
- Fix for inconsistent game state when players leave a game.
- Divider in chat window cannot be moved off-screen

  issues. Methods which directly manipulate GUI components can cause
  race conditions, and are now never called from main networking
  thread.
- Removed calls to deprecated methods
- Images can now be loaded from files (on server or not) or from
  within jar.

  alone.
